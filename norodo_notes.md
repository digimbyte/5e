# Organizations

## The Order of the Bound Scale
A secretive offshoot of Torm’s faith, the sect believed in physically perfecting mortals to better serve divine justice. While they outwardly claimed devotion to Torm, their interpretation was radical, focusing on merging mortal bodies with unnatural enhancements to create “ideal vessels” for divine will.

### Base of Operations: Highrock Monastery
Nestled deep within the Fairheight Mountains, Highrock was a secluded and fortified monastery, accessible only via narrow trails. Here, the sect conducted their experiments in secret, shielded from the eyes of the nearby cities.

### Their Relations with Caer Callidyrr
- The Order of the Bound Scale maintained a tenuous connection with the capital city of Caer Callidyrr.
- Officially, they were seen as an eccentric but tolerated religious group, catering to outlying villages like Sunderstaad with funeral rites and healing services.
- The authorities in Caer remained wary of their growing influence and strange practices. Rumors of their experiments were often dismissed as superstitions.
- The sect operated under the radar, leveraging political neutrality and occasionally aiding the city during times of plague or unrest.

# Your Connection to Sunderstaad and the Sect

**Sunderstaad**  
A small village in the shadow of the Fairheight Mountains, Sunderstaad was known for its hardy, faithful residents. You were raised in this village as a devout follower of Torm, aiding in local religious services and rituals.

**The Abduction**  
- The Order of the Bound Scale approached Sunderstaad under the guise of seeking apprentices for religious training.
- You, as a promising young devotee of Torm, were selected and taken to Highrock Monastery.

**The Simic Process**  
- At Highrock, you underwent the Simic Hybrid Process, a blend of alchemical science and divine ritual.
- It left you stronger but altered, your appearance grotesque to those around you.

**Abandonment**  
- Unable to reconcile their methods with your faith, you fled.
- Upon returning to Sunderstaad, the villagers—horrified by your new form—rejected you.
- Hunted and outcast, you began your wandering journey.
