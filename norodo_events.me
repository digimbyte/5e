# Year 1: Fleeing Highrock

**Key Event**: After your escape from the Order of the Bound Scale, you wandered through the Fairheight Mountains, exhausted and malnourished. One fateful evening, you encountered a blind traveler making their way through the rocky terrain.

**Contact**: **Erys Valemir**, a blind mystic wandering the mountains.  
Erys claimed to follow no god but instead sought balance in the world. Despite her blindness, she moved with uncanny precision, using a staff to guide her steps. She mistook you for a fellow pilgrim and offered to guide you to safer lands, asking only for your company in return.

**Dynamic**: Erys never questioned your robes or your silence about your past. In fact, she appreciated your quiet presence, finding comfort in your reverence for life. You, in turn, found solace in her wisdom and resilience. Her blindness allowed her to see past your appearance, treating you with dignity when others would recoil in fear.

**Parting Gift**: When you eventually parted ways at a small trading post on the outskirts of the mountains, Erys gave you a small amulet carved from polished bone, saying:  
> “The world is cruel, but balance exists. Wear this as a reminder that you are part of it, no matter what others see.”

# Year 2: Sunderstaad to Baldur’s Gate

**Key Event**: After leaving Sunderstaad, you made your way to **Baldur’s Gate**, a sprawling city where anonymity could be maintained amid the bustling crowds. Here, you found work in the Lower City as an assistant to **Doran Graive**, a mortician known for his pragmatic approach to death and the living.

**Torm’s Place in Baldur’s Gate**:  
While Torm is respected, Baldur’s Gate is more prominently influenced by deities like **Gond** (patron of craft and innovation) and **Umberlee** (feared by sailors). The **Order of the Radiant Heart**, an organization devoted to Torm, Tyr, and Helm, exists within the city, but its influence is minor compared to the city’s mercantile and seafaring deities. Your faith in Torm would have been seen as unusual but not unwelcome—many in Baldur’s Gate respect quiet, functional devotion.

**Contact**: **Doran Graive**, a pragmatic mortician who found value in your skill and discretion.  
He saw your dedication to funerary rites and appreciated your willingness to work with the dead others shunned. However, he didn’t speak much of faith, preferring a more grounded perspective on life and death.

**Why Winterhaven?**  
Doran had a cousin who had settled in the **Nentir Vale**, sending back stories of an expanding frontier with opportunity for healers and craftsmen. He casually mentioned this as he mused on the state of the world, saying:  
> “If there’s anywhere left to start fresh, it’s out there in the Vale. Seems folk there respect hard work.”

**Dynamic**: Doran didn’t press you about your past but valued your professionalism. He left a strong impression on you with his calm, almost clinical, view of mortality.

**Parting Words**:  
After rumors spread about your concealed appearance, forcing you to leave the city, Doran said:  
> “It’s a cruel thing when folk can’t look past shadows. Wherever you go, lad, just keep doing right by the dead. They’ll never judge you.”

# Year 3: Leaving Baldur’s Gate

**Key Event**: Rumors began to spread in Baldur’s Gate about a “monster in robes” haunting the mortuary. Fearing exposure and persecution, you decided to leave the city. You joined a caravan heading north along the Trade Way, adopting the guise of a pilgrim seeking refuge in distant lands.

**Contact**: **Tarnis Greyfall**, a gruff caravan driver and former mercenary.

**Why Tarnis Helped**:  
Tarnis was no follower of Torm but a pragmatic man who valued discretion and loyalty. He noticed your skill in patching wounds (from years of tending the dead and healing others) and offered you a place in his caravan in exchange for treating the injuries of travelers and beasts of burden.

**Dynamic**: Tarnis didn’t care much about your appearance or your faith. For him, your actions spoke louder than your concealed identity. Over shared meals by the fire, he shared his mercenary philosophy:  
> “Doesn’t matter where you’re headed, so long as you keep walking. Life’s just one long road, and the only thing that matters is keeping your boots on.”

**Influence on You**:  
Tarnis taught you that survival often requires pragmatism and self-reliance. His gruff wisdom reinforced your belief that Torm’s guidance could manifest through unexpected encounters, even in those without faith.

**Parting Ways**:  
Tarnis left you at a small roadside hamlet near **Daggerford**, where he introduced you to a merchant who would take you further north. Before departing, he gave you a small blade, saying:  
> “Don’t get into trouble, but if you do, make sure you finish it. Life’s tough enough without loose ends.”

# Year 4: Waterdeep and Beyond

**Key Event**: Arriving in **Waterdeep**, the bustling City of Splendors, you took refuge in the temple district, where anonymity was easy among the throngs of pilgrims and worshippers. Here, you offered your services as a healer and mortician, working discreetly for the impoverished and overlooked. Your quiet competence gained the respect of locals, though you kept to yourself to avoid drawing attention.

**Contact**: **Valthor Shadebrook**, a wandering merchant and storyteller.

**Why Valthor Helped**:  
Valthor was an opportunistic yet friendly merchant who dealt in curiosities, minor magical trinkets, and information. He struck up a conversation with you after noticing your plague doctor robes and hearing tales of your work in the temple district. Though initially curious for personal gain, he found your story intriguing and mentioned places along his travels where someone with your skills might find sanctuary.

**Dynamic**: Valthor’s advice was pragmatic, not altruistic. He spoke of regions like the Nentir Vale and **Winterhaven** as “frontier lands” where your abilities would be valued more than your appearance. His words resonated with your growing belief that Torm’s guidance often came through unexpected sources.

**Influence on You**:  
Valthor’s tales of frontier settlements stuck with you, planting the idea that a quieter, simpler life might await in such places. While you didn’t trust him completely, his stories added direction to your otherwise aimless wandering.

**Parting Ways**:  
When Valthor left Waterdeep to continue his trade routes, he offered you a small compass as payment for tending his wounds during his stay.  
> “It’s not enchanted or anything, but it’ll help you find your way. Or at least make you feel like you’ve got one.”

# Year 5: The Journey to Winterhaven

**Key Event**: Leaving Waterdeep, you joined a group of travelers heading toward the **Nentir Vale**, a region spoken of as a land of opportunity for those seeking a fresh start. Your intention was to find a quiet village where you could live in peace, away from scrutiny. Through twists of fate and chance, your journey led you to **Winterhaven**.

**Contact**: **Marvin Reedfallow**, a trader and community organizer traveling with the group.

**Why Marvin Helped**:  
Marvin was a pragmatic but kind-hearted halfling who coordinated the group’s travel. When you joined, your skills as a healer proved invaluable for tending to blisters, injuries, and illnesses during the trek. Marvin saw your value and subtly ensured that others in the group accepted your quiet, robed presence.

**Dynamic**: Marvin had no deep philosophical insights but offered practical advice on adapting to frontier life.  
> “You don’t need to be loud or proud to be useful,”  
he said during one campfire chat. He encouraged you to let your actions speak for you, which resonated deeply with your desire to live quietly and serve.

**Arrival in Winterhaven**:  
When the group reached Winterhaven, Marvin introduced you to **Eldrin Fallowmere**, the leader of the town’s small gravekeeper guild. Eldrin, overwhelmed by the city’s growing needs, was quick to offer you a place. Though you hadn’t planned to stop in Winterhaven, the combination of Marvin’s encouragement and the town’s genuine need convinced you to stay.

# Settling in Winterhaven

Upon settling, you became part of the fabric of Winterhaven—not as a figure of prominence, but as a quiet presence who worked diligently behind the scenes. Your plague doctor attire shielded your identity, but it also allowed others to focus on your actions rather than your appearance.

The townsfolk came to know you as a reliable and steadfast healer who asked for nothing in return, tending to the wounded and offering quiet prayers for the dead. You lived simply, echoing the words of your compatriots and listening more than you spoke. Your reclus
