# Year 1: Fleeing Highrock

**Key Event**:  After fleeing Highrock, you wandered through the **Fairheight Mountains**, exhausted and malnourished. One night, you encountered **Erys Valemir**, a blind mystic who moved with eerie precision. She mistook you for a fellow pilgrim and offered to guide you to safer lands, asking nothing but your company in return.

**Contact**: **Erys Valemir**, a blind mystic.  
She never questioned your silence or your appearance, only speaking of **balance** and the paths unseen. Over time, she helped you fashion a **new clothing kit**, a patchwork of old and new, and suggested a **scarred past by fire** to explain what lay beneath.

**Dynamic**:  Erys carried a quiet understanding, never prying but always **listening**. She sensed the weight you bore but knew better than to ask. During your travels, you admitted that your visage might offend others. When she inquired why, you hesitated before answering,  
*"An accident."*  
She responded with a simple suggestion—**fire**, her tone carrying more than one meaning.  

By your final week together, she had helped craft a new **woven mask and robes**, practical but concealing, allowing you to pass unnoticed. She did not pity you, nor did she fear you. That alone made her different.

**Parting Gift**:  Erys led you to the **gates of Caer Callidyrr**, where she offered **one final meal** before her departure. Before leaving, she placed a **bone-carved amulet** in your hands, whispering:  
> “The world is cruel, but balance exists. Wear this as a reminder that you are part of it, no matter what others see.”

**Finding Work**:  With the **monks of Highrock** present in the city, you remained unnoticed, seeking a quieter path. You turned to **burial rites and aftercare**, tending to the forgotten dead, adventurers lost to misfortune, and those without family. **Your mother’s sewing skills became invaluable**, piecing together broken bodies for their final rest.  

Among the dead, there were no questions—only silence.

# **Year 2: Caer Callidyrr to Baldur’s Gate**

**Key Event**:  
Settling in **Caer Callidyrr**, you took quiet work as an **undertaker and crypt keeper**, tending to the dead where others would not. Your skill in **preparing bodies for final rites** earned quiet appreciation, though you remained unseen and unheard by most.  

However, whispers began to spread—a **Torm worshiper working the crypts**, a healer among the dead. The **monks of Highrock** took notice, asking questions, searching for answers. The walls of sanctuary began to close. Rather than risk discovery, you fled **south to Kythyss**, seeking passage on a **merchant ship bound for Baldur’s Gate**.

**Torm’s Place in Baldur’s Gate**:  
Baldur’s Gate, unlike the **Moonshae Isles**, held no place for quiet reverence. The city thrived on trade and necessity, where **Gond, Umberlee, and coin** dictated fate more than faith. The **Order of the Radiant Heart**, a faction devoted to Torm, Tyr, and Helm, existed in the Upper City but held little sway over the common folk. To the Lower City, faith was **a means, not an end**.  

**Contact**: **Doran Graive**, a pragmatic mortician.  
In Baldur’s Gate, you sought **discreet work**, finding a place in the **Lower City morgues** under **Doran Graive**, a mortician who saw **value in silence and skill**. He appreciated your willingness to work with the **unclaimed and unwanted**, caring little for the reasons behind your concealed nature.

**Dynamic**:  
Doran did not speak much of **faith**, preferring the **cold certainty of death** over divine purpose. He taught you **efficiency in the trade**, how to work unnoticed, how to separate **practicality from sentiment**. In him, you saw a man untouched by the burdens of belief, a stark contrast to your own unwavering devotion.  

Yet, his indifference was a form of **acceptance**. He never asked why you hid. He only ensured you had **work, shelter, and purpose**.

**Parting Words**:  
As **whispers of your concealed identity** grew in Baldur’s Gate, Doran saw the signs before you did. He offered a final piece of advice before you were forced to leave.  

> *“It’s a cruel thing when folk can’t look past shadows. Wherever you go, lad, just keep doing right by the dead. They’ll never judge you.”*

# Year 3: Leaving Baldur’s Gate

**Key Event**: Rumors began to spread in Baldur’s Gate about a “monster in robes” haunting the mortuary. Fearing exposure and persecution, you decided to leave the city. You joined a caravan heading north along the Trade Way, adopting the guise of a pilgrim seeking refuge in distant lands.

**Contact**: **Tarnis Greyfall**, a gruff caravan driver and former mercenary.

**Why Tarnis Helped**:  
Tarnis was no follower of Torm but a pragmatic man who valued discretion and loyalty. He noticed your skill in patching wounds (from years of tending the dead and healing others) and offered you a place in his caravan in exchange for treating the injuries of travelers and beasts of burden.

**Dynamic**: Tarnis didn’t care much about your appearance or your faith. For him, your actions spoke louder than your concealed identity. Over shared meals by the fire, he shared his mercenary philosophy:  
> “Doesn’t matter where you’re headed, so long as you keep walking. Life’s just one long road, and the only thing that matters is keeping your boots on.”

**Influence on You**:  
Tarnis taught you that survival often requires pragmatism and self-reliance. His gruff wisdom reinforced your belief that Torm’s guidance could manifest through unexpected encounters, even in those without faith.

**Parting Ways**:  
Tarnis left you at a small roadside hamlet near **Daggerford**, where he introduced you to a merchant who would take you further north. Before departing, he gave you a small blade, saying:  
> “Don’t get into trouble, but if you do, make sure you finish it. Life’s tough enough without loose ends.”

# Year 4: Waterdeep and Beyond

**Key Event**: Arriving in **Waterdeep**, the bustling City of Splendors, you took refuge in the temple district, where anonymity was easy among the throngs of pilgrims and worshippers. Here, you offered your services as a healer and mortician, working discreetly for the impoverished and overlooked. Your quiet competence gained the respect of locals, though you kept to yourself to avoid drawing attention.

**Contact**: **Valthor Shadebrook**, a wandering merchant and storyteller.

**Why Valthor Helped**:  
Valthor was an opportunistic yet friendly merchant who dealt in curiosities, minor magical trinkets, and information. He struck up a conversation with you after noticing your plague doctor robes and hearing tales of your work in the temple district. Though initially curious for personal gain, he found your story intriguing and mentioned places along his travels where someone with your skills might find sanctuary.

**Dynamic**: Valthor’s advice was pragmatic, not altruistic. He spoke of regions like the Nentir Vale and **Winterhaven** as “frontier lands” where your abilities would be valued more than your appearance. His words resonated with your growing belief that Torm’s guidance often came through unexpected sources.

**Influence on You**:  
Valthor’s tales of frontier settlements stuck with you, planting the idea that a quieter, simpler life might await in such places. While you didn’t trust him completely, his stories added direction to your otherwise aimless wandering.

**Parting Ways**:  
When Valthor left Waterdeep to continue his trade routes, he offered you a small compass as payment for tending his wounds during his stay.  
> “It’s not enchanted or anything, but it’ll help you find your way. Or at least make you feel like you’ve got one.”

# Year 5: The Journey to Winterhaven

**Key Event**: Leaving Waterdeep, you joined a group of travelers heading toward the **Nentir Vale**, a region spoken of as a land of opportunity for those seeking a fresh start. Your intention was to find a quiet village where you could live in peace, away from scrutiny. Through twists of fate and chance, your journey led you to **Winterhaven**.

**Contact**: **Marvin Reedfallow**, a trader and community organizer traveling with the group.

**Why Marvin Helped**:  
Marvin was a pragmatic but kind-hearted halfling who coordinated the group’s travel. When you joined, your skills as a healer proved invaluable for tending to blisters, injuries, and illnesses during the trek. Marvin saw your value and subtly ensured that others in the group accepted your quiet, robed presence.

**Dynamic**: Marvin had no deep philosophical insights but offered practical advice on adapting to frontier life.  
> “You don’t need to be loud or proud to be useful,”  
he said during one campfire chat. He encouraged you to let your actions speak for you, which resonated deeply with your desire to live quietly and serve.

**Arrival in Winterhaven**:  
When the group reached Winterhaven, Marvin introduced you to **Eldrin Fallowmere**, the leader of the town’s small gravekeeper guild. Eldrin, overwhelmed by the city’s growing needs, was quick to offer you a place. Though you hadn’t planned to stop in Winterhaven, the combination of Marvin’s encouragement and the town’s genuine need convinced you to stay.

# Settling in Winterhaven

Upon settling, you became part of the fabric of Winterhaven—not as a figure of prominence, but as a quiet presence who worked diligently behind the scenes. Your plague doctor attire shielded your identity, but it also allowed others to focus on your actions rather than your appearance.

The townsfolk came to know you as a reliable and steadfast healer who asked for nothing in return, tending to the wounded and offering quiet prayers for the dead. You lived simply, echoing the words of your compatriots and listening more than you spoke. Your reclusive nature earned you privacy, while your skill earned you respect, though you sought neither.

When the **Orcish War** broke out, you answered the call—not as a warrior, but as a healer and custodian of the fallen. You worked tirelessly to mend the wounded, bury the dead, and comfort grieving families, all while remaining in the background. Your efforts were not celebrated, but they were felt deeply by those you served.

In Winterhaven, you found a fragile peace—a chance to practice Torm’s teachings in quiet devotion, away from the judgment of the past. It was not the life you had envisioned, but it was one you accepted with humility and resolve.
