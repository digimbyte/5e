I am Norodo - Nor'o or Nero for simplicity, I hail from the village of Sunderstaad, a devout but isolated community at the base of the Fairheight Mountains. 
We were simple folk, bound by our faith in Torm and our unwavering commitment to one another. Our lives were steeped in rituals of reverence and duty, and from a young age, I felt the pull of divine purpose. 
But the shadow of Highrock Monastery loomed over usâ€”an enigmatic order whose visits were rare yet revered, cloaked in promises of holy enlightenment. It was they who chose me, a promising acolyte, for a higher calling. 
Little did I know, that calling would lead to my pilgrimage, my exile, and the path I walk now, shaped by faith."
