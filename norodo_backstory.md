# A Pilgrim of Torm, Shaped by Shadows

I was born into a devout family who followed **Torm**, the guardian of duty and eternal justice. My childhood was steeped in the doctrines of courage, selflessness, and the sacred bond between life and death. From a young age, I was a dedicated student of Torm, studying his teachings and serving in rituals meant to honor the living and guide the departed to their rest. My dream was to one day become a revered cleric, upholding Torm’s justice and compassion.

However, fate had different plans. As a teenager, I was selected for the **Simic Hybrid Process**, a procedure known only in whispers. Promised as a divine experiment, this process was said to create enhanced individuals capable of enduring greater trials in Torm’s service. The truth was far grimmer. The sect’s leaders believed augmenting the mortal form could create a better vessel for divine will, but the results were far from consistent.

My body was altered, reshaped into something neither fully mortal nor monstrous. The process left me stronger but grotesque, my form alien and unsettling to those who once embraced me as kin. At first, I tried to remain within the sect, but whispers of heresy grew. Devout followers began to look upon me with fear and disdain, seeing me not as a blessed creation but as an abomination. The elders turned their backs on me, and the once-familiar halls of the sect became suffocating with rejection and suspicion.

Eventually, I was abandoned—cast out under the guise of **pilgrimage**. With nowhere to go, I wandered, seeking solace in Torm’s light while battling the growing darkness within. My grotesque appearance made living among others difficult. Villagers called me a monster, and adventurers hunted me as prey, mistaking me for a dangerous creature. The robes I once wore out of reverence became my shield, concealing my body and allowing me to exist without spreading fear.

In the early days of my exile, I stumbled upon a worn lute abandoned in the corner of a ruined chapel. Drawn to its melancholic shape and the promise of expression, I took it with me. At first, my clumsy hands struggled with the strings, but in time, the lute became an extension of my soul. Each note was a lament, each chord a prayer, and every melody a quiet vow to Torm and to those who suffered as I had. Through the lute, I found a way to process my pain, turning sorrow into something tangible, something meaningful. 

For years, I traveled from place to place, guided by chance and the quiet belief that Torm’s light still watched over me. I found work where I could, tending to the dead and offering final rites in secret. Along the way, I encountered both kindness and cruelty: a blind mystic who accepted me without judgment, a gruff caravan leader who valued my skills over appearances, and a halfling merchant whose practical wisdom reminded me that survival is a journey, not a destination. These fleeting connections strengthened my resolve to live by Torm’s teachings, even as the world seemed to reject me.

Finally, five years after my exile, my wandering brought me to **Winterhaven**, a burgeoning city I reached more by chance than design. Though hesitant at first, I found a small community willing to look past my reclusive nature. The people of Winterhaven appreciated my skills, and my plague doctor attire became a part of my persona, allowing me to work quietly without drawing undue attention. For the first time in years, I found a fragile sense of peace.

Then, eight months later, the **Orcish War** began. Winterhaven fell under siege, and I once again found myself surrounded by death and chaos. The call to action was immediate, and I stepped forward to assist in evacuating refugees, tending to the dead, and treating the wounded. It was during this time that the true horror began.

One fateful night, while preparing mass graves, I encountered a field of twisted corpses, their faces frozen in expressions of unspeakable terror. Whispers filled the air, accusing me of failure, betrayal, and cowardice. I fled, unable to complete my work, the haunting voices following me long after the battlefield fell silent.

When Winterhaven fell, I joined the survivors in their flight eastward, my reclusive nature returning as I grappled with the guilt and torment of that night. In the newly established **New Winterhaven**, I dedicated myself to rebuilding—physically, emotionally, and spiritually. I worked tirelessly as a healer and mortician, quietly tending to the community and ensuring the dead found peace. The lute became my solace, a ritual companion that allowed me to channel my grief and guilt into haunting melodies. Under the light of the full moon, I play songs of lamentation and tribute, honoring those who were lost and vowing to guide others away from the pain I endured.

Though I now serve as part of **Alaynia Vice’s** elite team, the shadows of my past still linger. At night, I write poetry in my diary, capturing the fear, guilt, and fragile hope that define my existence. I cling to Torm’s light, praying it will guide me to understanding. Yet, deep down, I fear that the horrors I faced cannot be escaped and that the whispers will one day claim me. The music I play under the moonlight serves as both my anchor and my prayer, a vow to persevere and to never forget those shaped by shadows like myself.
