# A Pilgrim of Torm, Shaped by Shadows

## **I. Origins: Sunderstaad and Family**

I am Norodo—Nor’o, or Nero, for those who prefer brevity. I hail from **Sunderstaad**, a devout but isolated community at the base of the **Fairheight Mountains**. We were simple folk, bound by our faith in **Torm**, our days shaped by duty, our nights by prayer. Our faith was our foundation, our shield, our purpose.  

At the heart of our village stood **the Totem of Torm**, a towering spire that had once been the mast of a great ship, preserved by magic or alchemy, now harder than steel. It was said to be a relic from ages past, a symbol of resilience and unwavering faith. When the light of dawn struck it just right, the sigils carved upon its surface shimmered, as though blessed by the god himself. We gathered there for prayer, seeking Torm’s guidance before beginning our daily tasks.  

The temple itself was not in our village, but in **Highrock Monastery**, perched upon the mountain above us. The monks descended at appointed times to **bless our people, heal the sick, and remind us of our duty**. When they came, we offered tribute—**food, clothing, blankets**, all hand-crafted from nearby resources. It was our way of serving, a sacred exchange where both faith and necessity were honored.  

Maintaining the village, preserving our way of life, and providing assistance to the monastery monks when they visited—**this was our purpose**. Every child learned their role early, every family contributed, and through this, our devotion remained unshaken.  

My father was a fisherman, braving the tides to provide for our village, while my mother, a seamstress, wove together the fabric of our daily lives. She taught me to sew, to mend what was broken, to preserve what could still serve—a lesson that extended beyond mere cloth. I had a younger brother, eager and full of fire, and a baby sister whose laughter echoed through our home like a hymn.  

On my **eighth birthday**, the monastery came for my uncle. He was chosen, honored, taken into their ranks to serve **Highrock Monastery**, the sacred order that watched over us. It was a day of celebration. A day that planted a seed of longing within me. I knew then—I wished to follow.

## **II. Chosen by the Monastery**  

When the monastery returned years later, they came for me. Their visits were rare, their words measured, and their selection was never questioned. To be chosen was to serve—a path walked by only a few, whispered about with both reverence and longing.  

They did not seek the strongest or the most skilled. They sought **devotion**, those who lived by the tenets of Torm not just in prayer, but in action. When the monks arrived in **Sunderstaad**, they moved through the village like specters, speaking in low voices to the elders, observing in silence.  

When they called my name, I **did not hesitate**.  

I left **Sunderstaad** with my head high, my heart filled with certainty. My family watched in solemn pride, my mother pressing a bundle of cloth into my hands—a simple token, stitched with her own hands, a reminder of home. My father clasped my shoulder, his grip firm but his words few. My younger brother stood at a distance, his expression unreadable, while my baby sister clung to my mother’s side, too young to understand.  

As I stepped beyond the village, the **Totem of Torm** stood in the distance, its ancient mast glinting in the sunlight, as though watching over my departure.  

I was leaving behind everything I had known. But I was walking into **something greater**.  

I did not look back.  

---

## **III. Life in the Monastery**  

The temple halls of Highrock became my world. Every day was devotion. Mornings began with sweeping the great stone corridors, ensuring the temple stood as pure as our faith. The midday hours were spent in study, poring over scripture, debating doctrine, learning the rites of passage, the weight of judgment, the burden of mercy.  

We did not merely learn Torm’s laws—we **lived** them. The monastery taught that duty was not for oneself, but for all. That sacrifice was expected, that **faith was not spoken, but acted upon**. And so, I acted. We tended to the weak, we buried the fallen, we trained in prayer and discipline. I stood alongside my brethren, strong in faith, unshaken in purpose.  

Yet Highrock’s teachings extended beyond scripture. The monks spoke in **Deep Speech**, an ancient tongue they claimed was closer to the divine than any written word. They said the gods did not hear through mere language, but through **intention, through emotion, through the very essence of one’s soul**. Words alone could be twisted, but spoken truth, bound in power, could not be denied.  

I listened. I learned. And I spoke.

## **IV. The Rites of Devotion** *(Preparation for the Ritual)*  

The elders watched. They measured. And when they deemed me ready, I was chosen for the **Rites of Devotion**—a trial reserved for those who would take their faith beyond the limits of flesh.  

They said nothing of what lay ahead. Only that it was sacred. Only that it was a **privilege**.  

I was prepared in body and spirit. My diet was stripped to the barest essentials—nothing but water, root broth, and bitter herbs. I fasted for days, purging weakness. Isolation followed. Locked away in dark stone chambers, I meditated to the echoes of my own breath. I was not to speak, not to think of self. **Only Torm. Only duty.**  

When they came for me, I was led in silence. My skin was marked with ink—**glyphs of devotion**, sigils of binding that they said would guide the process. I did not question.  

The final days were spent in the deep sanctum, submerged in salt baths that left my body weightless, **adrift between faith and the unknown**.  

And then, beneath the full moon of the equinox, they led me to the ritual chamber.  

---

## **V. The Simic Process**  

The sanctum lay beneath the monastery—a cavernous stone chamber carved with symbols older than any temple I had seen. The air was thick with incense, the scent of burning herbs and brine.  

At the center of the room stood the altar—**a slab of obsidian**, polished black, slick with ritual oils. The stone was cool as they laid me upon it, my robes stripped away, my body bare save for the inked glyphs.  

Above me, **a portal in the ceiling**, its arch lined with silver. Through it, the **full moon** hung low, impossibly bright. The alignment was perfect—**the celestial gate opened only on the correct equinox, a night when divine power reached its zenith**. The monks said nothing. They did not need to. **I understood. This was the moment.**  

They spoke in **Deep Speech**, their voices layered, reverberating through the chamber, the very air **vibrating with the weight of their words**. These were not prayers—**they were commands**, binding reality to their will. The symbols on the walls glowed in response, as if recognizing the language.  

Then, the pain came.  

I awoke to silence. My body was changed. **Reshaped. Altered beyond recognition.** The monks did not speak of it afterward. **Not a word.**  

---

## **VI. After the Process**  

I was kept away from the other acolytes, hidden from those who had once been my kin. **This was my higher form**, I was told. I was stronger, suited for a **greater purpose**.  

But doubt took root. The original scriptures spoke of **purity**, yet this process felt like corruption. Some elders called it **a test**, a challenge to my devotion. Others claimed that the body was temporary, that only the teachings mattered. **But I knew in my heart—Torm would not wish for this.**  

My questions brought whispers. My solitude became isolation. And in the catacombs, where I was sent to meditate, my mind began to break.  

The elders saw. Some feared what would come next, whispering of heresy and consequence. But one, my overseer "Bur'wian", saw something else—potential, purpose. He warned me in secret, urging me to flee before escalation turned to execution. Officially, it was a death sentence. Unofficially, a promise of sanctuary, a path unseen but not abandoned. And so, under the guise of **pilgrimage**, I left. A journey to seek Torm—or exile in all but name?

So I obeyed. Because faith is not for oneself—it is for something greater.  

Torm’s will is all that matters. And I **will serve.**

## **VII. The Road Home, and the Price of Change**

With nowhere to go, I thought of **home**. Even though it had been eight years, I told myself that **Sunderstaad** would understand, that those I had grown up with would see past the flesh and recognize the soul beneath.

I was wrong.

When I returned to the outskirts of my village, I kept to the **shadows**, watching from a distance, unseen. The **Totem of Torm** still stood tall at its center, untouched by time, its presence a beacon of faith. I yearned to stand before it once more, to let its presence ground me, to prove to myself that I still belonged.

I never made it that far.

A child saw me first, a scream splitting the air as they fled in **terror**. Doors slammed, voices rose, and before I could step forward, **they came with torches and steel**. I heard my name spoken in **fear**, twisted into something unrecognizable. They did not see their lost son returned—they saw a **creature**, an abomination who had devoured their son.

My father did not come to the front. My mother did not call for them to stop. My **brother**, now a man, was among them, his sword drawn. **He did not hesitate.** I fled before I was forced to defend myself, sprinting into the night like the beast they believed me to be.

I did not go far. I could not. **I could not let go.**

For several weeks, I lived in the **forests of Highrock** and the **caves near the village**, surviving off the land, watching from afar. I tried to help in small ways—**mending fishing nets left unattended, leaving game at the edge of the woods, ensuring no beasts prowled too close**. I thought perhaps, in time, they would see the truth.

But my presence only bred more **fear**. Whispers of a **lurking monster** spread. Soon, **adventurers** were hired to **hunt me down**, eager for a bounty on the nameless horror haunting the edges of Sunderstaad.

There was no home for me here.

One night, I stood at the outskirts of the village for the final time, staring at the **Totem of Torm** in silence. The moonlight gleamed against its surface, the ancient mast standing tall against the night sky.

I bowed my head, whispered a prayer, and left.

**Sunderstaad was no longer my home. Perhaps it never was.**

## **VIII. The Pilgrimage Begins**

I had nowhere left to go. My only path forward led **south**, back through **Highrock Monastery**, the only route to civilization. With no other choice, I kept to the **shadows**, avoiding the monks who might recognize me. The monastery, once my home, now felt like the walls of a cage I had outgrown. I moved quickly, slipping past its towering stone walls, unseen in the dead of night.

By the time I emerged from the mountain roads, exhaustion clung to me like a second skin. My **weeks lingering near Sunderstaad** had taken their toll, the weight of rejection pressing on my shoulders like an anchor. My faith was unshaken, but my sense of belonging had crumbled. 

It was during these wandering days that I found **the lute**, drawn by its melancholic shape and the promise of expression.

It was a broken thing, discarded in the corner of a **ruined chapel**, half-buried beneath dust and time. Its strings were snapped, its wood worn, but something about it **called to me**. I took it in my hands, turning it over, feeling the weight of forgotten music. **"A voice without words."** I said to myself unprompted.

I did not know how to play, but I tried. **I restrung it. I tuned it. I plucked the strings in the early dawn, fumbling, learning.**

And that was when I met **Erys Valemir**.

A blind mystic, wandering alone, staff tapping against the stone. She moved as though she could see the world clearer than most, her face serene, untouched by the fear that had chased me from my home. **She did not recoil at my presence. She did not ask what I was.** Instead, she sat beside me as I struggled with the strings, listening, waiting.

> "It is broken," She said.

> I nodded. "I'm trying to fix it."

> "So are you."

I had no answer.

Erys stayed with me for **several nights**, guiding me through unfamiliar paths, teaching me the ways of the land. She never asked about my past. Never questioned my silence. And in turn, **I learned to listen**, not just to her words but to the world around me. **The music of the wind. The rhythm of the earth beneath my feet.**


During our travels, I admitted that my appearance might unsettle others. When she asked why, I hesitated before answering.  
*"An accident,"* I said, the words hollow even to my own ears.  

Erys suggested a fire—her tone almost carrying a double meaning, not just a question but a statement. She did not pry further, only nodding in quiet understanding. Over our final days of travel, we fastened together a new clothing kit for me, a patchwork of old and new. It was cumbersome, but it helped draw less ire and attention. **Scars of fire** became my new cover, a quiet deception wrapped beneath robes and a simple woven mask.

When we reached the next **trading post**, she turned to me with a small smile. 

> "The world is cruel, but balance exists. Wear this as a reminder that you are part of it, no matter what others see."

She placed a small **bone-carved raven head amulet** in my hands, smooth and polished. I held it close, feeling the weight of her words settle into my bones.

And then she was gone, disappearing into the roads beyond, leaving me to walk my path alone once more.

But this time, I carried a **song** with me.

**The pilgrimage had begun.**

---

For years, I traveled from place to place, guided by chance and the quiet belief that Torm’s light still watched over me. I found work where I could, tending to the dead and offering final rites in secret. Along the way, I encountered both kindness and cruelty: a blind mystic who accepted me without judgment, a gruff caravan leader who valued my skills over appearances, and a halfling merchant whose practical wisdom reminded me that survival is a journey, not a destination. These fleeting connections strengthened my resolve to live by Torm’s teachings, even as the world seemed to reject me.

Finally, five years after my exile, my wandering brought me to **Winterhaven**, a burgeoning city I reached more by chance than design. Though hesitant at first, I found a small community willing to look past my reclusive nature. The people of Winterhaven appreciated my skills, and my plague doctor attire became a part of my persona, allowing me to work quietly without drawing undue attention. For the first time in years, I found a fragile sense of peace.

Then, eight months later, the **Orcish War** began. Winterhaven fell under siege, and I once again found myself surrounded by death and chaos. The call to action was immediate, and I stepped forward to assist in evacuating refugees, tending to the dead, and treating the wounded. It was during this time that the true horror began.

### *[Origin: Haunted One]*

One fateful night, while preparing mass graves, I encountered a field of twisted corpses, their faces frozen in expressions of unspeakable terror. Whispers filled the air, accusing me of failure, betrayal, and cowardice. I fled, unable to complete my work, the haunting voices following me long after the battlefield fell silent.

---

When Winterhaven fell, I joined the survivors in their flight eastward, my reclusive nature returning as I grappled with the guilt and torment of that night. In the newly established **New Winterhaven**, I dedicated myself to rebuilding—physically, emotionally, and spiritually. I worked tirelessly as a healer and mortician, quietly tending to the community and ensuring the dead found peace. The lute became my solace, a ritual companion that allowed me to channel my grief and guilt into haunting melodies. Under the light of the full moon, I play songs of lamentation and tribute, honoring those who were lost and vowing to guide others away from the pain I endured.

Though I now serve as part of **Alaynia Vice’s** elite team, the shadows of my past still linger. At night, I write poetry in my diary, capturing the fear, guilt, and fragile hope that define my existence. I cling to Torm’s light, praying it will guide me to understanding. Yet, deep down, I fear that the horrors I faced cannot be escaped and that the whispers will one day claim me. The music I play under the moonlight serves as both my anchor and my prayer, a vow to persevere and to never forget those shaped by shadows like myself.
