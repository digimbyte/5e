Shape of the cursed

[intro male humming]

[male vocal]
[Verse 1]
Cold: the forge where fires falter,
Sharp: the blade that carves the soul.
Bound: a shape by crueler altar,
Worn: the weight of what they stole.

[Chorus]
Oh, rise and tread through shadowed water,
Break the chains, though none will see.
Sing the song of sons and daughters,
Wrought by wrath, but striving free.

[Verse 2]
Dark: the veil of fear unspoken,
Deep: the well of sorrowâ€™s call.
Marked: the scars of trust now broken,
Strong: the will to rise from fall.

[Chorus]
Oh, rise and tread through shadowed water,
Break the chains, though none will see.
Sing the song of sons and daughters,
Wrought by wrath, but striving free.

[Bridge]
Steel and stone shall crack and wither,
Ash and bone shall feed the sea.
Yet hearts endure through storm and shiver,
Bound by hope, eternally.

[finale, chorus]
Oh, rise and tread through shadowed water,
Break the chains, though none will see.
Sing the song of sons and daughters,
Wrought by wrath, but striving free.

[end]
