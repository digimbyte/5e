Shape of the cursed

[intro male humming]

[male vocal]
[Verse 1]
Cold: the forge where fires falter,
Sharp: the blade that carves the soul.
Bound: a shape by crueler altar,
Worn: the weight of what they stole.

[Chorus]
Oh, rise and tread through shadowed water,
Break the chains, though none will see.
Sing the song of sons and daughters,
Wrought by wrath, but striving free.

[Verse 2]
Dark: the veil of fear unspoken,
Deep: the well of sorrowâ€™s call.
Marked: the scars of trust now broken,
Strong: the will to rise from fall.

[Chorus]
Oh, rise and tread through shadowed water,
Break the chains, though none will see.
Sing the song of sons and daughters,
Wrought by wrath, but striving free.

[Bridge]
Steel and stone shall crack and wither,
Ash and bone shall feed the sea.
Yet hearts endure through storm and shiver,
Bound by hope, eternally.

[finale, chorus]
Oh, rise and tread through shadowed water,
Break the chains, though none will see.
Sing the song of sons and daughters,
Wrought by wrath, but striving free.

[end]


it should be similar to this structure:
Cold: the air and water flowing.
Hard: the land we call our home.
Push to keep the dark from coming,
Feel the weight of what we owe.

This: the song of sons and daughters,
Hide the heart of who we are.
Making peace to build our future,
Strong, united, working till we fall.

Cold: the air and water flowing.
Hard: the land we call our home.
Push to keep the dark from coming,
Feel the weight of what we owe.

This: the song of sons and daughters,
Hide the heart of who we are.
Making peace to build our future,
Strong, united, working till we fall.

And we all lift, and we're all adrift together, together.
Through the cold mist, till we're lifeless together, together.

There once was a ship that put to sea
The name of the ship was the Billy O' Tea
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down
Oh blow, my bully boys, blow (huh)

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguing is done
We'll take our leave and go

She'd not been two weeks from shore
When down on her a right whale bore
The captain called all hands and swore
He'd take that whale in tow (huh)

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguing is done
We'll take our leave and go

Da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Before the boat had hit the water
The whale's tail came up and caught her
All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her
When she dived down low (huh)

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguing is done
We'll take our leave and go

No line was cut, no whale was freed
The captain's mind was not of greed
And he belonged to the Whaleman's creed
She took that ship in tow (huh)

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguing is done
We'll take our leave and go

Da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

For forty days or even more
The line went slack then tight once more
All boats were lost, there were only four
But still that whale did go (huh)

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguing is done
We'll take our leave and go

As far as I've heard, the fight's still on
The line's not cut, and the whale's not gone
The Wellerman makes his regular call
To encourage the captain, crew and all (huh)

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguing is done
We'll take our leave and go

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguing is done
We'll take our leave and go
