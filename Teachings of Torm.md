*"There once was a soldier who stood watch for three days without rest. When asked why he did not take a moment to sleep, he said, 'Because if I falter, others may fall. Duty is my shield, and vigilance my blade.' When his watch ended, the town he protected remained untouched by harm. The soldier, overcome by exhaustion, passed away at his post. To this day, his body remains as a homage to his unwavering sacrifice. The village, inspired by his courage, remains ever vigilant, needing no other guards. Every year, the townsfolk leave gifts at his resting place, honoring his memory and worshipping Torm through his ultimate act of duty."*

In his later years, the knight passed away peacefully, his deeds celebrated in tales that reminded all of the power of mercy.
